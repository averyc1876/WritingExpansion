# Writing Expansion - [No releases yet](https://github.com/averyc1876/WritingExpansion/releases)
Writing Expansion is a mod for Vintage Story that adds depth to writing in books and on paper. Main features:

- Rework of writing system, tools and UI
- More in-depth paper making, similar to vanilla multi-step recipes
- Rebalanced parchment, better reasons to use it for writing

This mod was designed as a starting point for me to use in other projects I have planned in the future. *Stay tuned for them!*

## Writing Expansion is currently in development. I am working to make a first release for or shortly after VS 1.21 comes out.
